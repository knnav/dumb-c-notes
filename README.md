# knnav's Dumb C Notes

### Note: this is HEAVILY WIP and VERY early in the process

I'm using this repo to have a small journal/guide for myself as I'm learning C. Sometimes I need to ELI5 stuff to myself and documenting that on code just seems like the right thing to do. (Also it helps me actually process stuff, go figure).

I'm leaving this as a public repo in case someone finds it useful (hopefully someone eventually will!). I'm trying to be very through with explanations mostly because my aim with this repository is to eventually have a comprehensive C guide that I can consult/understand later.

This is all written in C, with my notes being written on the comments, all the code should be functional if you run it and want to inspect what it's doing on the inside. Actually, a lot of the guide is being written through printf calls to make sure the code actually does what I expect it to do, lol.
